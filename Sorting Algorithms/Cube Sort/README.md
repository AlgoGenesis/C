### Problem Statement Description

CubeSort is a sorting algorithm primarily designed for parallel processing, but it can be implemented in a single-threaded environment as well. The main goal of CubeSort is to efficiently sort a list of elements by dividing the data into smaller segments that can be sorted independently and then merged. This approach makes it particularly suitable for systems that can perform parallel processing.

### Algorithm Overview

CubeSort works by organizing the data into a "cube" where each dimension represents a different key by which the data can be sorted. Hereâ€™s a simplified overview of how the algorithm works:

1. *Initialization*: The data is divided into segments that can be sorted independently. Each segment is referred to as a "stripe".
2. *Sorting Stripes*: Each stripe is sorted independently. This can be done using any efficient sorting algorithm (like [QuickSort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/quick-sort/), [MergeSort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-sort/), etc.).
3. *Merging*: Once all stripes are sorted, they are merged back together. The merging process is designed to maintain the overall order.

The unique aspect of CubeSort is its ability to sort and merge simultaneously, which optimizes the use of available processing power and memory bandwidth.

### Time Complexity

The theoretical time complexity of CubeSort in an ideal parallel processing environment is O(log n), because each stripe can be sorted independently and in parallel, and the merging process can also be parallelized. However, in a single-threaded environment, the complexity would typically be dominated by the sorting algorithm used for the stripes (e.g., O(n log n) for MergeSort or QuickSort) and the merging process.
