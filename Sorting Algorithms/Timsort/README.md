### Problem Statement

Timsort is a hybrid sorting algorithm derived from merge sort and insertion sort. It is designed to perform well on many kinds of real-world data. The algorithm was introduced by Tim Peters in 2002 for use in the Python programming language. The main idea behind Timsort is to take advantage of the fact that real-world data often contains ordered sequences, and it merges these sequences efficiently.

### Algorithm Overview

1. **Identify Runs**: The array is divided into small segments called "runs" which are either already sorted or sorted using insertion sort. The minimum size of a run is typically 32, but this can vary.

2. **Sort Runs Using Insertion Sort**: Each run is sorted using insertion sort, which is efficient for small datasets.

3. **Merge Runs Using Merge Sort**: The sorted runs are merged together using a merge sort approach. This merging process is optimized to minimize the number of comparisons and data movements.

4. **Galloping Mode**: Timsort uses a technique called "galloping" to speed up the merging process when one run is much longer than the other.

### Time Complexity

- **Best Case**: \(O(n)\) when the data is already sorted.
- **Average Case**: \(O(n \log n)\)
- **Worst Case**: \(O(n \log n)\)

The time complexity is efficient due to the combination of insertion sort for small runs and merge sort for larger runs, along with the optimization techniques like galloping.
