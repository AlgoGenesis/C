# Tree Sort Algorithm

## Description

Tree Sort is a sorting algorithm that utilizes a binary search tree (BST) to sort elements. It works by inserting elements into the BST and then performing an in-order traversal to retrieve the elements in sorted order. This method leverages the properties of binary search trees, allowing efficient insertion and retrieval.

### Problem Definition

Given:
- An array `arr` of `n` elements.

Objective:
- Sort the array in ascending order using the Tree Sort algorithm.

### Algorithm Overview

1. **Insert Elements**: Build a binary search tree by inserting each element from the array into the tree.
2. **In-Order Traversal**: Perform an in-order traversal of the tree, which visits nodes in sorted order and stores the result back in the array.
3. **End Sorting**: The algorithm completes when all elements have been retrieved from the tree in sorted order.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of Tree Sort is generally as follows:

- **Best Case**: `O(n log n)` when the tree is balanced.
- **Average Case**: `O(n log n)` for a random distribution of elements.
- **Worst Case**: `O(n^2)` when the tree becomes unbalanced (e.g., when inserting sorted data into an empty tree).

### Advantages

- The algorithm maintains a sorted structure in the tree, allowing efficient insertions and deletions.
- Provides an elegant way to sort elements using tree structures.

### Disadvantages

- The performance can degrade to `O(n^2)` for certain input distributions (e.g., sorted data).
- Requires additional memory for the tree structure, which may not be suitable for memory-constrained environments.

### Conclusion

Tree Sort is a practical sorting algorithm that utilizes binary search trees to achieve sorted output. While it can be efficient for balanced trees, its performance heavily relies on the input data distribution. Despite its drawbacks, it serves as a valuable educational tool for understanding tree structures and their applications in sorting.
