# Merge Sort

## Description

### Problem Definition

Given:
- An array of integers.

Objective:
- Sort the array using the Merge Sort algorithm.

### Algorithm Overview

1. **Divide**: Split the array into two halves until each subarray contains a single element.
2. **Conquer**: Recursively sort the two halves.
3. **Combine**: Merge the sorted halves to produce the sorted array.

### Time Complexity

The average and worst-case time complexity of Merge Sort is \( O(n \log n) \), where \( n \) is the number of elements in the array. The best-case time complexity is also \( O(n \log n) \).
