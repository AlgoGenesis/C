## Zigzag Conversion

# Problem Description
The Zigzag Conversion problem involves rearranging a string in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows and then reading it line by line. The task is to convert the given string into this zigzag pattern and then return the concatenated string read line by line.

## Solution Approach
Edge Case Handling: If numRows is 1 or greater than or equal to the length of the string, return the string as it is.
Zigzag Pattern Generation:
Create an array of strings (or a list) to hold each row.
Use a loop to iterate through the characters of the string and determine their respective row based on the current direction (down or up).
Change direction when reaching the top or bottom row.
Concatenation: After populating the rows, concatenate the strings from each row to form the final result.


## Example
P   A   H   N
A P L S I I G
Y   I   A
Reading line by line, the output would be "PAHNAPLSIIGY".

# Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because we iterate through the string once to fill the rows and then concatenate the rows to form the final result.

# Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(n) as well, since we are storing the characters in a number of rows and also creating a result string that holds the final output.
