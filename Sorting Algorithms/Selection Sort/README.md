# Selection Sort Program

## Overview
This C program implements the **Selection Sort** algorithm, which is a straightforward sorting technique. It divides the input list into two parts: a sorted part and an unsorted part. The algorithm repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest, depending on sorting order) element from the unsorted part and moves it to the end of the sorted part.

## Features
- Sorts an array of integers in ascending order.
- Uses a `swap` function to exchange elements.
- Implements the selection sort algorithm efficiently.

## Requirements
- A C compiler (e.g., GCC)

## Compilation Instructions
To compile the program, navigate to the directory containing the `selection.c` file and run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
gcc selection.c -o selection
