# Spiral Order Matrix Traversal

# Problem Description

Spiral Matrix Traversal is an algorithm that traverses a given M×N matrix in a spiral pattern, starting from the top-left element and moving in a clockwise direction. The traversal continues inward until all elements have been visited.

# Visual Representation

For a 4×4 matrix:

# 1  2  3  4
# 12 13 14  5
# 11 16 15  6
# 10  9  8  7

The traversal order will be : 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 8 → 9 → 10 → 11 → 12 → 13 → 14 → 15 → 16

# Algorithm

The algorithm follows these steps:

1. Initialize four boundary variables:

top: First row
bottom: Last row
left: First column
right: Last column


2. While there are unvisited elements:

    1. Traverse right: Move from left to right in the top row
    2. Traverse down: Move from top to bottom in the rightmost column
    3. Traverse left: Move from right to left in the bottom row
    4. Traverse up: Move from bottom to top in the leftmost column


3. After each traversal:

Update the corresponding boundary
Check if boundaries are still valid

# Time and Space Complexity

1. Time Complexity: O(M×N), where M is the number of rows and N is the number of columns
2. Space Complexity: O(1) for traversal, O(M×N) if storing the result
