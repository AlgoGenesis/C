# Description

A jagged array (or an array of arrays) is a type of two-dimensional array where the rows can have different numbers of columns. This project covers basic operations on jagged arrays in the C programming language. We provide functions to initialize a jagged array, insert elements, delete elements, search for elements, and display the array in a readable format.

For instance, consider a jagged array where each row has a different number of elements:

Row 0: 1, 2
Row 1: 3, 4, 5
Row 2: 6

With jagged arrays, each row can be customized to fit the data's varying length requirements.

# Operations

  1.Initialize Jagged Array: Dynamically allocate memory for each row, allowing each row to have a specified number of columns.
  2.Insert Elements: Add elements at specific positions within each row.
  3.Delete Elements: Remove elements from particular rows, with subsequent elements shifting to fill the gap.
  4.Search Elements: Locate specific elements within the jagged array, returning their position if found.
  5.Display Jagged Array: Print the contents of the jagged array in a structured, readable format.

# Example

Consider a jagged array with three rows:

 1.Row 0 has 2 columns.
 2.Row 1 has 3 columns.
 3.Row 2 has 1 column.

Jagged Array:

1   2
3   4   5
6

If we add an element 7 to Row 2, it will look like this:

1   2
3   4   5
6   7

If we delete the element 4 from Row 1, the array will look like this:

1   2
3   5
6   7

# Program Explanation

In this program, we:

  1.Prompt the user to input the number of rows and specify the number of columns for each row.
  2.Initialize the jagged array based on user input.
  3.Insert and delete elements as specified by the user.
  4.Search for specific elements within the array.
  5.Display the jagged array in a structured format.
  6.This functionality allows flexible operations on arrays where rows have variable lengths, enhancing efficiency in memory usage and data handling.
