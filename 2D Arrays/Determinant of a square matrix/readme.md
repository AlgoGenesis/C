# Determinant of a Square Matrix in C

This repository contains a C program that calculates the determinant of a square matrix using three different methods:
1. **Recursive Method** (Laplace Expansion)
2. **Gaussian Elimination**
3. **LU Decomposition**

## Importance of Determinant in Linear Algebra

The determinant is a fundamental property of square matrices in linear algebra and plays a key role in several applications, including:
- **Solving systems of linear equations**: The determinant helps check if a system has a unique solution. If the determinant of the coefficient matrix is zero, the system has either no solutions or infinitely many.
- **Matrix Inverses**: A matrix is invertible if and only if its determinant is non-zero. The inverse is crucial in various matrix operations like transformations and solving equations.
- **Geometric Interpretations**: The determinant can be interpreted as the scaling factor of linear transformations and is linked to concepts such as area, volume, and orientation in vector spaces.
- **Eigenvalue problems**: Determinants help in finding the characteristic polynomial of a matrix, leading to the discovery of eigenvalues.

In numerical applications, the determinant is essential for understanding properties like stability, invertibility, and conditioning of matrices.

## Features of the Program
- **Multiple Methods**: Users can compute the determinant using three distinct methods, providing flexibility for educational and practical purposes:
  - **Recursive Laplace Expansion**: Suitable for small matrices (high computational complexity for large matrices).
  - **Gaussian Elimination**: Efficient for larger matrices with lower computational cost.
  - **LU Decomposition**: Provides both the determinant and LU factors for additional operations like matrix inversion.
  
- **User-Friendly Input**: The program allows users to input square matrices of size up to 10x10 (can be extended as needed).

## How to Use

### Prerequisites
- A C compiler (GCC, Clang, etc.)
- Basic understanding of C programming
- Familiarity with matrix operations and determinants

## Recursive Method (Laplace Expansion): 
This method expands along the first row of the matrix recursively. It is simple but computationally expensive (O(n!)), and is best suited for small matrices.

## Gaussian Elimination: 
The matrix is transformed into an upper triangular form using row operations. The determinant is then calculated as the product of the diagonal elements of the upper triangular matrix. This method is efficient (O(n^3)) and useful for large matrices.

## LU Decomposition:
 The matrix is decomposed into a lower and an upper triangular matrix (L and U) such that A = LU. The determinant is the product of the diagonal elements of U. This method is also efficient (O(n^3)) and widely used in numerical applications.

### Program Flow
#### Input Phase: 
The user inputs the matrix size and elements.
#### Selection Phase: 
The user selects the method for calculating the determinant.
#### Computation Phase: 
The determinant is calculated using the selected method.
#### Output Phase: 
The program displays the computed determinant.
#### Advantages of Different Methods
Recursive Method: 
Offers an intuitive understanding of the determinant calculation but is inefficient for large matrices.
Gaussian Elimination: 
Highly efficient for larger matrices. It can also handle singular matrices effectively.
LU Decomposition: 
Provides not only the determinant but also the factors required for matrix inversion or solving systems of equations
