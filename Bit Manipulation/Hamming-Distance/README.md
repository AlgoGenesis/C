This is a simple C program that calculates the Hamming distance between two integers. The Hamming distance is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different when the integers are represented in binary form.

-->How It Works
The program uses the XOR operation to identify which bits differ between the two integers and then counts the number of 1s in the XOR result to determine the Hamming distance.

-->Formula
Given two integers x and y, the Hamming distance is calculated as follows:

XOR the two integers (x ^ y) to get a result where each 1 bit represents a position where the bits in x and y differ.
Count the number of 1s in the XOR result, which gives the Hamming distance.
