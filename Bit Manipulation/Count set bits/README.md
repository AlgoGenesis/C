# Count the Number of Set Bits

## Description
This algorithm counts the number of 1 bits (set bits) in the binary representation of a given integer. Counting set bits is useful in various fields like cryptography, networking, and data compression.

## Example Usage
Enter an integer: 29
Number of set bits in 29 is 4

## Complexity
** Time Complexity **: 
O(number of set bits) — The loop runs once for each set bit.

** Space Complexity **: 
O(1) — Constant space usage.

## Applications
- Cryptography: For analyzing binary data.
- Networking: Useful for IP address and network mask operations.
- Data Compression: Helps in efficient data encoding and decoding
