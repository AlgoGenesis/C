## Fibonacci Heaps

Fibonacci heaps are a type of heap data structure that provides a more efficient way to perform priority queue operations compared to traditional binary heaps. They are particularly useful in applications that require a large number of decrease-key and delete operations, such as network optimization algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm) and minimum spanning tree algorithms (e.g., Prim's algorithm).

### Key Features

- **Amortized Efficiency**: Fibonacci heaps support a variety of operations with excellent amortized time complexities:
  - **Insert**: O(1)
  - **Find Minimum**: O(1)
  - **Union**: O(1)
  - **Extract Minimum**: O(log n)
  - **Decrease Key**: O(1)
  - **Delete**: O(log n)

- **Structure**: Fibonacci heaps consist of a collection of trees that follow the min-heap property, where each tree is a heap-ordered tree. The trees are linked together in a circular doubly linked list, facilitating efficient merging and operations.

- **Lazy Merging**: Unlike binary heaps, Fibonacci heaps delay the consolidation of trees, which allows for faster merge operations and better amortized time performance.

### Use Cases

Fibonacci heaps are ideal for applications that involve frequent merging of heaps or require efficient decrease-key operations, such as:

- Graph algorithms (Dijkstra’s and Prim’s)
- Network routing and optimization
- Any application involving priority queues with many updates
