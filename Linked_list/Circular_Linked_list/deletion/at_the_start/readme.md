# Circular Linked List - Deletion from the Start

This program contains an implementation of a **Circular Linked List** with the ability to **delete a node from the start** of the list.

## Node Structure

Each node in the singly linked list consists of two components:
1. **Data**: The integer value stored in the node.
2. **Next Pointer**: A reference to the next node in the linked list.

## Insertion at the End

To add a new node at the end of the linked list:
- Allocate memory for the new node.
- Assign the provided data to the new node.
- If the list is empty, the new node becomes the head.
- Otherwise, traverse to the last node of the list and update the last nodeâ€™s next pointer to point to the new node. Then, set the new node pointer to point at head.

## Deletion from the Start

To delete a node from the start of the linked list:
- If the list is empty, print a message indicating that list is empty and there is nothing to delete.
- If the list has only single element, free the node and set the head to `NULL`.
- Store a reference to the current head node (in last and temp).
- Traverse the list to the last node and update the last node's pointer to point to the next node of head.
- Update the head to next of current head
- Free the memory of the old head node.

## Display the List

The `display` function traverses the linked list and prints the data of each node. It continues until the end of the list is reached (i.e., when the next pointer points to the `head` again after printing the complete list). The output format shows the data values of the nodes followed by an arrow, ending with `Back to head` to indicate the end of the list i.e., again pointing to the start of list (head).


## Full Example

The complete implementation demonstrates the following functionalities:
1. **Insertion**: Nodes can be added to the end of the list.
2. **Deletion**: A node can be removed from the start of the list.
3. **Display**: The current state of the linked list can be displayed before and after deletion operations.

## Output

When running the program, the output shows the linked list before and after the deletion of the first node. For example:

- **Original List**:
10 -> 20 -> 30 -> 40 -> (Back to head)

- **Deleting from the beginning...**:

  List after deletion from the start:
20 -> 30 -> 40 -> (Back to head)


## How to Run

To run the implementation:
1. Copy the code into a file named `circular_linked_list.c`.
2. Compile the program using a C compiler, such as GCC.
3. Execute the compiled program.

## Key Points

- **Memory Management**: Ensure to free the memory of deleted nodes to avoid memory leaks.
- **Deletion at the Start**: This implementation supports the removal of a node from the start of the linked list.
- **Traversal**: The display function helps in visualizing the structure of the linked list at any point in time.
