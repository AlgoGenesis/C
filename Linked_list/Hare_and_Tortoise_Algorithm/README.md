## Hare and Tortoise Algorithm

## Description
The Hare and Tortoise Algorithm, also known as Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm, is a technique used to detect cycles in a sequence or linked list. It utilizes two pointers, one moving at a slow pace (the tortoise) and the other moving at a faster pace (the hare). This method is particularly useful for determining if a linked list contains a cycle, which can help avoid infinite loops in data structures.

### Problem Definition
Input: A linked list or sequence of elements.
Output: A boolean value indicating whether a cycle exists in the sequence.

### Algorithm Overview
1) Initialization:
>Start with two pointers, tortoise and hare. Initialize both to the head of the linked list.

2) Iterate Through the List:
>Move tortoise one step forward and hare two steps forward in each iteration.
>Check if hare or hare.next becomes null. If so, there is no cycle, and the algorithm should return false.
>If tortoise meets hare, a cycle exists, and the algorithm should return true.

3) Result:
>If the loop exits without tortoise meeting hare, return false, indicating no cycle was found.
### Time Complexity
>Best Case: 
O(1) –  If there is no cycle, the algorithm quickly determines this.
>Average Case: 
O(n) – The algorithm traverses the list in a linear manner.
>Worst Case: 
O(n) – In the presence of a cycle, the pointers may meet within the length of the list.
