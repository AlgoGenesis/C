# Doubly Linked List - Deletion at the Start

This program demonstrates an implementation of a **Doubly Linked List** with the functionality to **delete a node at the start** of the list.

## Node Structure

Each node in the doubly linked list consists of three components:
1. **Data**: The integer value stored in the node.
2. **Next Pointer**: A reference to the next node in the linked list.
3. **Previous Pointer**: A reference to the previous node in the linked list.

## Insertion at the End

To add a new node at the end of the doubly linked list:
- Allocate memory for the new node.
- Assign the provided data to the new node.
- If the list is empty, the new node becomes the head.
- Otherwise, traverse to the end of the list, update the last nodeâ€™s next pointer to point to the new node, and set the new node's previous pointer to the last node.

## Deletion at the Start

To delete a node at the start of the doubly linked list:
- If the list is empty, print a message indicating that there is nothing to delete.
- Store a reference to the current head node.
- Update the head pointer to point to the next node in the list.
- If the new head is not `NULL`, set its previous pointer to `NULL`.
- Free the memory of the old head node to prevent memory leaks.

## Display the List

The `display` function is used to traverse the doubly linked list and print each node's data from the head to the end of the list. The output format shows the data values of the nodes connected by double arrows (`<->`), ending with `NULL` to indicate the end of the list.

## Full Example

The complete implementation demonstrates the following functionalities:
1. **Insertion**: Nodes can be added to the end of the list.
2. **Deletion**: A node can be removed from the start of the list.
3. **Display**: The current state of the doubly linked list can be displayed before and after deletion operations.

## Output

When running the program, the output shows the doubly linked list before and after the deletion of the first node. For example:

- **Before Deletion**: The list might look like `10 <-> 20 <-> 30 <-> 40 <-> NULL`.
- **After Deletion at Start**: The updated list would appear as `20 <-> 30 <-> 40 <-> NULL`.

## How to Run

To run the implementation:
1. Copy the code into a file named `doubly_linked_list.c`.
2. Compile the program using a C compiler, such as GCC.
3. Execute the compiled program.

## Key Points

- **Memory Management**: Ensure to free the memory of deleted nodes to avoid memory leaks.
- **Deletion at the Start**: This implementation supports removing a node from the start of the doubly linked list, with proper handling of both the `next` and `prev` pointers.
- **Bidirectional Traversal**: The list can be traversed in both forward and backward directions, though the display function in this example focuses on forward traversal.
