# Memory function-Knapsack Problem

The Memory Function (Top-down Memoization) is a dynamic programming approach where the problem is solved recursively and results are cached to avoid redundant calculations.


## Problem Statement
Given:

    n: Number of items
    weights[]: An array of weights of the items
    values[]: An array of values of the items
    W: Maximum weight capacity of the knapsack

The goal is to determine the maximum value that can be obtained by selecting a subset of the items without exceeding the weight capacity W.
## Dynamic Programming Solution
Steps:
 1. user's input the number of items, their respective weights and values, and the sackâ€™s capacity.
 2. The program fills the memoization table to compute the maximum value achievable.
 3. It then backtracks to print the items that contribute to this maximum value.
 
## Initial memorization table


| i/j | 0   | 1  | 2  | 3   | 4  |
| :-------- | :------- | :------- | :------| :-------| :-------|
| `0` | `0` |  `0` | `0` | `0` | `0` | 
| `1` | `0` |  `-1` | `-1` | `-1` | `-1` | 
| `2` | `0` |  `-1` | `-1` | `-1` | `-1` |
