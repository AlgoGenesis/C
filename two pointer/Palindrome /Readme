PROBLEM STATEMENT :
To determine if a string is a valid palindrome, we first normalize the string by removing all non-alphanumeric characters and converting all letters to lowercase.
Then, we check if the string reads the same forward and backward by comparing the cleaned string with its reverse.

Sample Input 1:
"A man, a plan, a canal, Panama"

Sample Output 1:
The string is a palindrome.

Explanation:
After removing spaces and punctuation and ignoring case, the string becomes:
"amanaplanacanalpanama"
This string is the same forwards and backwards, so it is a valid palindrome.
