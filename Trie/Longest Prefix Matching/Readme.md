A **Longest Prefix Matching using Trie** ,  is a common problem that involves finding the longest prefix of a query string from a set of predefined words. It is used in various applications such as autocomplete systems, IP routing, and pattern-matching algorithms. A Trie (Prefix Tree) is an ideal data structure to solve this problem efficiently due to its prefix-based storage and fast lookup times.

### Structure:

To efficiently solve the Longest Prefix Matching problem, we use a Trie (Prefix Tree). The Trie stores the dictionary words, allowing quick traversal and prefix matching.

- **Root Node**: The root node is empty and serves as the starting point for all operations.
- **Children**: Each node in the Trie represents a character, and its children correspond to the subsequent characters in the dictionary words.
- **Word End Marker**: A boolean flag is used to mark the end of a valid word in the Trie

### Basic Operations:
1. **Insertion**: Start at the root node and insert each character of the word into the Trie, creating new nodes when necessary.
Mark the final node as a terminal node to indicate the end of a valid word.
   
2. **Longest Prefix Matching**: 1- For each query string, traverse the Trie character by character.
2- Keep track of the longest valid word prefix encountered during the traversal.
3- Stop when a character is not found or the end of the query is reached.

3. **Deletion**: Deleting a word from a trie requires you to unmark the terminal node for that word. If this node no longer forms a part of another word, you can also delete the unused nodes.

### Real-Life Example:
Imagine you’re building an autocomplete feature for a search engine or contact list. As the user types, you want to suggest the longest matching prefix from a list of known words.
- For a dictionary with the words "apple", "app", and "banana", and the query string "application":
- The longest matching prefix is "app".
- The word "apple" is also a valid prefix but does not match beyond the first three characters.

### Applications of Trie:

1. **Autocomplete Systems**:
   - In systems like search engines, contact lists, or typing suggestions, Longest Prefix Matching can provide word or phrase completions as a user types.
   - **Example**: Typing "appl" can suggest both "apple" and "application", with "apple" being the longest match.

2. ** IP Routing**:
   - In networking, Longest Prefix Matching is used to find the most specific route for an IP address based on the longest prefix that matches the address.
   - **Example**: Given routing paths like 192.168.0.0/16 and 192.168.1.0/24, and the query IP 192.168.1.45, the system selects 192.168.1.0/24 as the best match.


3. **Text Processing**:
   - When scanning large texts, you can use Longest Prefix Matching to efficiently identify words or phrases from a dictionary.
   - **Example**: In a spell-checking system, finding the longest valid prefix of a partially typed word can help suggest completions or corrections.

### Example of a Trie:
We insert the dictionary words: "apple", "app", "banana", and "bat" into the Trie.

```
Root
│
├── a
│   └── p
│       ├── p (end of word: "app")
│       │   └── l
│       │       └── e (end of word: "apple")
│
├── b
    ├── a
    │   └── t (end of word: "bat")
    └── n
        └── a
            └── n
                └── a (end of word: "banana")

```

In this trie:
- For the query string "application", the longest matching prefix from the dictionary is "app".
- For the query string "batman", the longest matching prefix is "bat"
- For the query string "ban", there is no exact match for the full query, but the longest 
  matching prefix is "ban".

### Time Complexity:
- **Insert Operation**: The time complexity of inserting a word into a Trie is O(m), where m is the length of the word. Inserting n words into the Trie results in a time complexity of O(n * m).
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(n * m), where n is the number of words, and m is the average length of the words. Each character in the Trie takes up space, and in the worst case, each character in each word will have its own node.

### Optimizations:
- **Compressed Trie**: In a Compressed Trie, sequences of nodes with only one child are merged into a single node to save space, especially when the dataset has long prefixes.

### Conclusion:
Longest Prefix Matching using Trie is an efficient technique to search for the longest matching prefix in a set of dictionary words. The Trie structure provides a powerful way to handle large datasets of strings and perform fast lookups, making it ideal for use cases like autocomplete, IP routing, and text processing.
