### Problem Statement:
Given a string `s` and a dictionary `wordDict`, you need to determine if `s` can be segmented into one or more dictionary words. Each word in the dictionary can be reused multiple times.

---

### Approach:
This solution uses a **Trie** and **Dynamic Programming (DP)** to solve the problem. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Trie**: 
   - A Trie is used to store the words from the dictionary. Each node in the Trie represents a character, and the Trie will help quickly check if substrings of the given string are present in the dictionary.

2. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: 
   - The `dp` array is used to store whether the string up to index `i` can be segmented into words from the dictionary.
   - `dp[i]` will be `true` if the substring `s[0...i-1]` can be segmented into valid words.

---

### Dry Run of the Code:

Letâ€™s walk through an example:

```c
char s[] = "leetcode";
char *wordDict[] = {"leet", "code"};
```

**Step 1: Inserting words into the Trie**

We first insert each word from `wordDict` into the Trie.

- **Insert "leet"**:
  - Starting from the root node:
    - `l`: No child node for `'l'`, create a new node.
    - `e`: No child node for `'e'`, create a new node.
    - `e`: No child node for the second `'e'`, create a new node.
    - `t`: No child node for `'t'`, create a new node and mark it as a terminal node (`isWord = true`).
  
- **Insert "code"**:
  - Starting from the root node:
    - `c`: No child node for `'c'`, create a new node.
    - `o`: No child node for `'o'`, create a new node.
    - `d`: No child node for `'d'`, create a new node.
    - `e`: No child node for `'e'`, create a new node and mark it as a terminal node (`isWord = true`).

The Trie now contains the words `"leet"` and `"code"`.

**Step 2: Dynamic Programming Initialization**

- Create a DP array `dp` of size `strLength + 1` (to handle indices up to the length of the string `s`), and initialize `dp[0] = true`, since an empty string can be segmented (base case).

```c
bool dp[strLength + 1] = {false};
dp[0] = true;
```

So, initially:

```
dp = [true, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false]
```

**Step 3: Traversing through the string and updating DP**

We will iterate through the string `s` and check all possible substrings using the Trie.

1. **At index `i = 0` (dp[0] = true)**:
   - Start at the root of the Trie and check the substring starting from `i = 0`.
   - Traverse `'l' -> 'e' -> 'e' -> 't'`: this forms the word `"leet"`, which exists in the dictionary. 
   - Mark `dp[4]` as `true` because the substring `s[0...3]` can be segmented.

    So, the DP array becomes:

    ```
    dp = [true, false, false, false, true, false, false, false, false]
    ```

2. **At index `i = 1`, `i = 2`, `i = 3`**:
   - Since `dp[1]`, `dp[2]`, and `dp[3]` are `false`, we skip these indices because no valid segmentation has been found up to these points.

3. **At index `i = 4` (dp[4] = true)**:
   - Start at the root of the Trie and check the substring starting from `i = 4`.
   - Traverse `'c' -> 'o' -> 'd' -> 'e'`: this forms the word `"code"`, which exists in the dictionary.
   - Mark `dp[8]` as `true` because the substring `s[4...7]` can be segmented.

    So, the DP array becomes:

    ```
    dp = [true, false, false, false, true, false, false, false, true]
    ```

**Final DP State:**

```
dp = [true, false, false, false, true, false, false, false, true]
```

**Step 4: Return the Result**
- Since `dp[strLength]` (i.e., `dp[8]`) is `true`, it means that the entire string `"leetcode"` can be segmented into words from the dictionary.

Thus, the function returns `true`.

---

### Explanation of Output:
- The string `"leetcode"` can be segmented into `"leet"` and `"code"`, both of which are present in the dictionary, so the output will be:

```
The string "leetcode" can be segmented into words from the dictionary.
```

### Key Concepts:
1. **Trie**: Efficiently stores the dictionary words and allows for quick lookups of prefixes in the input string.
2. **Dynamic Programming**: Used to track which parts of the string can be segmented into valid dictionary words.
