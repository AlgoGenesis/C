# Dynamic Weighted Graph Search Algorithm

## Description

This program implements a Dynamic Weighted Graph Search Algorithm designed to find the shortest path in a graph where edge weights can change dynamically during the search process. Unlike traditional algorithms (e.g., Dijkstraâ€™s), this approach adapts to fluctuating conditions, such as increasing path costs due to congestion or other external factors.

### Problem Definition

Given:
- A graph represented by an adjacency matrix where each entry represents the weight (cost) of an edge between nodes.
- A set of nodes and edges, input by the user.
- Dynamic weight adjustments that increase edge weights based on usage.

#### Objective:

Find the shortest path between a start node and a goal node while adapting to weight changes in real time as the search progresses.
### Algorithm Overview

**1. Input the Graph:**
Prompt the user for the number of nodes and edges.
For each edge, input the two connected nodes and the initial weight.

**2. Initialize Search Data:**
Set up arrays to track distances from the start node, visited nodes, and previous nodes for path reconstruction.

**3. Dynamic Path Search:**
For each step, find the node with the minimum current distance that hasn't been visited.
Dynamically update the weights of edges connected to this node to simulate real-time changes.
Re-evaluate neighboring nodes to maintain the shortest path.

**4. Output the Shortest Path:**
Display the total path cost and the sequence of nodes forming the shortest path from start to goal.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity is approximately O(n^2), where n is the number of nodes. Each node and its neighbors are processed once, similar to Dijkstra's algorithm, but with additional updates to edge weights.

### Example Code
The complete code for the Dynamic Weighted Graph Search Algorithm is as below:
```c 
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <limits.h>

#define MAX_NODES 100
#define INF INT_MAX

int graph[MAX_NODES][MAX_NODES];   // Adjacency matrix
int distance[MAX_NODES];           // Stores shortest distance from start node
int visited[MAX_NODES];            // Tracks visited nodes
int previous[MAX_NODES];           // To reconstruct the path
int n;                             // Number of nodes in the graph

void update_weights_dynamically(int node) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (graph[node][i] != INF) {
            graph[node][i] += 2;
        }
    }
}

int find_min_distance() {
    int min = INF, min_index = -1;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (!visited[i] && distance[i] < min) {
            min = distance[i];
            min_index = i;
        }
    }
    return min_index;
}

void dynamic_weighted_search(int start, int goal) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        distance[i] = INF;
        visited[i] = 0;
        previous[i] = -1;
    }
    distance[start] = 0;

    for (int count = 0; count < n - 1; count++) {
        int current = find_min_distance();
        if (current == -1) break;

        visited[current] = 1;
        update_weights_dynamically(current);

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (!visited[i] && graph[current][i] != INF && 
                distance[current] + graph[current][i] < distance[i]) {
                distance[i] = distance[current] + graph[current][i];
                previous[i] = current;
            }
        }
    }

    if (distance[goal] == INF) {
        printf("No path from %d to %d\n", start, goal);
    } else {
        printf("Shortest path cost from %d to %d: %d\n", start, goal, distance[goal]);
        printf("Path: ");
        int path[MAX_NODES], index = 0;
        for (int v = goal; v != -1; v = previous[v]) {
            path[index++] = v;
        }
        for (int i = index - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            printf("%d ", path[i]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }
}

int main() {
    int start, goal;
    printf("Enter the number of nodes: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            graph[i][j] = (i == j) ? 0 : INF;
        }
    }

    int edges;
    printf("Enter the number of edges: ");
    scanf("%d", &edges);
    printf("Enter edges (u v weight) format:\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < edges; i++) {
        int u, v, w;
        scanf("%d %d %d", &u, &v, &w);
        graph[u][v] = w;
        graph[v][u] = w;
    }

    printf("Enter the start node: ");
    scanf("%d", &start);
    printf("Enter the goal node: ");
    scanf("%d", &goal);

    dynamic_weighted_search(start, goal);

    return 0;
}
```

### Example 

Assume a graph with 4 nodes and edges defined as:
**Graph Edges:**
Edge (0, 1) with weight 5
Edge (1, 2) with weight 2
Edge (2, 3) with weight 1
Edge (0, 3) with weight 9

### Example Input

Enter the number of nodes: 4
Enter the number of edges: 4
Enter edges (u v weight) format:
0 1 5
1 2 2
2 3 1
0 3 9
Enter the start node: 0

Enter the goal node: 3

### Expected Output Recived 

Shortest path cost from 0 to 3: [Calculated Cost]
Path: 0 -> [Intermediate Nodes] -> 3

### Memory Management

The adjacency matrix is statically allocated for simplicity. For larger graphs, dynamic memory allocation could be used to reduce memory footprint.

### Key Points

- The algorithm is designed for dynamic environments, adapting path costs based on current node interactions.
- It efficiently recalculates shortest paths in real time, useful in applications like traffic-based navigation and adaptive routing in networks.
- Users can adjust the weight update function to model various real-world conditions.
