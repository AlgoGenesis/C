## Introduction
The **Handshaking Lemma** and various **Tree Properties** form the foundation for understanding graphs and trees in computer science and mathematics. They’re widely used in network theory, data structures, and algorithm design.

## Handshaking Lemma
The **Handshaking Lemma** is a key concept in graph theory that relates the total number of edges in a graph to the sum of vertex degrees.

### Formula and Explanation
- **Formula**: The Handshaking Lemma states that in any undirected graph:
  
  \[
  2 \times \text{number of edges} = \sum \text{(degrees of all vertices)}
  \]

- This lemma tells us that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is always even.

### Example
Consider a simple undirected graph with three vertices A, B, and C, and two edges (A-B, B-C):

- **Vertices**: A, B, C
- **Edges**: (A-B), (B-C)
- **Degrees**:
  - Vertex A: 1
  - Vertex B: 2
  - Vertex C: 1
- **Application of Handshaking Lemma**:

  \[
  2 \times \text{number of edges} = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4
  \]

  Hence, this satisfies the lemma since we have two edges and the sum of degrees is 4.

## Interesting Tree Properties
Trees are a specific type of graph with unique properties. Here’s a breakdown of key properties and useful formulas related to trees.

### Properties of Trees
1. **Acyclic Connected Graph**: A tree is an undirected, connected graph with no cycles.
2. **N Nodes and N-1 Edges**: A tree with `N` nodes has exactly `N-1` edges.
3. **Unique Path**: Between any two nodes in a tree, there is exactly one path.
4. **Degree of Leaf Nodes**: Leaf nodes (end nodes) have a degree of 1.

### Tree Formulas
- **Number of Edges**: `Edges = Nodes - 1`
- **Sum of Degrees**:
  
  \[
  \sum \text{(degrees of all nodes)} = 2 \times (\text{number of edges})
  \]

- **Rooted Tree Properties** (for rooted trees):
  - Height of a tree: Maximum number of edges from root to any leaf.
  - Total nodes at depth `d`: `2^d` for a binary tree.
  
### Example
Consider a tree with 4 nodes: A, B, C, D and edges A-B, A-C, A-D.

- **Properties Check**:
  - **Number of nodes**: 4
  - **Number of edges**: 3 (satisfies `N-1` rule)
  - **Degree sum**: Degree(A) = 3, Degree(B) = 1, Degree(C) = 1, Degree(D) = 1 → Sum = 6 (which is `2 x edges`)

## Applications
The Handshaking Lemma and Tree Properties are applied in:

1. **Network Analysis**: Used to analyze and design communication and computer networks.
2. **Data Structures**: Essential in binary trees, binary search trees, heaps, etc.
3. **Algorithm Design**: Helps in developing algorithms for shortest path, spanning tree, and network flow.
4. **Social Network Theory**: Handshaking Lemma can model friend relationships and connectivity.
5. **Distributed Systems**: Tree properties are used to design and manage hierarchies in distributed databases.

## Summary
- **Handshaking Lemma**: Relates total degrees to the number of edges in any undirected graph.
- **Tree Properties**: Trees have a unique structure, are acyclic, and have `N-1` edges if they have `N` nodes.
- **Formulas**: Useful for calculations involving edges, degrees, and paths.

This knowledge is crucial in **graph theory**, **data structures**, and **network algorithms**, providing the mathematical foundation to solve many complex problems efficiently.
