### C Code: Graph Coloring using Greedy Algorithm

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdbool.h>

#define V 4

// Function to check if the color assignment is valid for the given vertex
bool isSafe(int v, int graph[V][V], int color[], int c) {
    for (int i = 0; i < V; i++)
        if (graph[v][i] && color[i] == c)
            return false;
    return true;
}

// Recursive function to assign colors to vertices
bool graphColoringUtil(int graph[V][V], int m, int color[], int v) {
    if (v == V)
        return true;

    for (int c = 1; c <= m; c++) {
        if (isSafe(v, graph, color, c)) {

            color[v] = 0;

# Graph Coloring Algorithm in C

This project demonstrates the Graph Coloring algorithm using a greedy approach implemented in C. The algorithm tries to color the vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.

## Description

Graph coloring is a way of coloring the vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. This problem is widely used in scheduling, register allocation in compilers, and many other optimization areas.

### Problem Statement

Given a graph represented by an adjacency matrix, and an integer `m` representing the number of colors, assign a color to each vertex such that:
- No two adjacent vertices have the same color.
- The solution uses at most `m` colors.

### Solution Approach

This implementation uses a backtracking approach:
1. **Color Assignment**: It attempts to color each vertex starting from vertex 0.
2. **Backtracking**: If the current color assignment leads to a conflict, it backtracks and tries another color.
3. **Stopping Condition**: The algorithm stops if all vertices are successfully colored or if no solution exists.

## Usage

### Requirements
- C compiler (like GCC).

### Running the Program

1. **Compile** the code using the following command:
   ```bash
   gcc graph_coloring.c -o graph_coloring
   ```
2. **Execute** the program:
   ```bash
   ./graph_coloring
   ```

The program will output a possible coloring for the graph if a solution exists with the given number of colors, or it will indicate that no solution is possible.

### Code Structure

- **isSafe**: Checks if it’s safe to color a vertex with a particular color.
- **graphColoringUtil**: Tries to color each vertex and recursively backtracks if needed.
- **graphColoring**: The main function that initializes color assignments and starts the recursive coloring.

## Example

Using the adjacency matrix:
```
graph[V][V] = {
    {0, 1, 1, 1},
    {1, 0, 1, 0},
    {1, 1, 0, 1},
    {1, 0, 1, 0}
};
```

With `m = 3` colors, a possible output is:
```
Solution exists with the following color assignment:
Vertex 0 ---> Color 1
Vertex 1 ---> Color 2
Vertex 2 ---> Color 3
Vertex 3 ---> Color 1
```

This result assigns colors such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.

## Limitations

- This approach is not efficient for large graphs, as it uses a backtracking technique that has exponential time complexity in the worst case.
- The solution may not be optimal for large and complex graphs.

---

### Notes

- Adjust the adjacency matrix and `m` (number of colors) as needed to test different graphs.
- This code can be modified to use a non-greedy approach for graphs where a minimal coloring is essential.
