Theoretically we need log N + 1 comparisons in worst case. If we observe, we are using two comparisons per iteration except during final successful match, if any. In practice, comparison would be costly operation, it wonâ€™t be just primitive type comparison. It is more economical to minimize comparisons as that of theoretical limit. See below figure on initialize of indices in the next implementation.
In the while loop we are depending only on one comparison. The search space converges to place l and r point two different consecutive elements. We need one more comparison to trace search status.
