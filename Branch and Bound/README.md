# Branch and Bound Algorithm

## Description  
The Branch and Bound algorithm is an optimization technique used for solving various combinatorial and optimization problems. It systematically explores the solution space by dividing it into smaller subproblems (branching) and calculating bounds for these subproblems to determine whether they can lead to an optimal solution.

## Problem Definition  
**Given:**

A combinatorial optimization problem requiring the identification of the best solution from a finite set of solutions.

**Objective:**

Find the optimal solution that minimizes or maximizes a given objective function.

## Algorithm Overview  
The Branch and Bound approach systematically explores the solution space by creating a tree of subproblems. It branches by dividing the problem into smaller parts and evaluates bounds for each subproblem. If a bound is worse than the current best solution, that branch is pruned. The algorithm continues until all branches are explored or pruned, leading to the optimal solution.

## Steps:
1. Initialize the best known solution and a queue for subproblems.
2. Create the initial subproblem (root of the tree).
3. While there are subproblems in the queue:
   - Dequeue a subproblem and calculate its bound.
   - If the bound is better than the current best solution:
     - Branch into subproblems.
     - Enqueue the new subproblems.
   - If a subproblem leads to a feasible solution that is better than the current best, update the best solution.
4. Repeat until all subproblems are explored or pruned.

## Functions:
- `calculateBound(subproblem)`: Computes the bound for a given subproblem to determine if further exploration is necessary.
- `branch(subproblem)`: Divides a subproblem into smaller subproblems.
- `updateBestSolution(solution)`: Updates the best-known solution if the current solution is better.

## Applications  
- **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**: Finding the shortest possible route that visits a set of cities and returns to the origin city.
- **Job Assignment Problem**: Assigning tasks to resources while minimizing the total cost or maximizing efficiency.
- **N-Queens Problem**: Placing N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other.
- **N-Puzzle Problem**: Sliding tiles on a grid to reach a goal state.
- **0/1 Knapsack Problem**: Selecting items with given weights and values to maximize the total value without exceeding the weight limit.
- **Generation of Binary Strings**: Generating all possible binary strings of a given length.

## Time Complexity  
The time complexity of the Branch and Bound algorithm can vary depending on the problem and how effective the bounding and pruning strategies are. In the worst case, it can explore all possible solutions, leading to exponential time complexity, O(n!), but with effective pruning, it often finds solutions much faster in practice.
