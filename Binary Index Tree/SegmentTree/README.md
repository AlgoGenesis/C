# Segment Tree

## Description
A segment tree is a binary tree used for answering range queries and updates efficiently in `O(log n)` time. It divides the array into segments and processes range operations like sum, min, or max over intervals. With modifications like lazy propagation, it can handle range updates without recalculating the entire tree.
