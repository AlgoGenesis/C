# Pointer Manipulation and Arithmetic in C

## Description
This program demonstrates the use of pointers for dynamic memory allocation, accessing array elements, and performing pointer arithmetic in C. Understanding pointers is crucial for efficient memory management and performance optimization in C programming.

## Problem Statement
The program prompts the user to enter a number of integers and dynamically allocates memory to store these integers. It then uses pointer arithmetic to fill the array and display the values entered by the user. This showcases how pointers can be used to access and manipulate data stored in memory.

## Example
When executed, the program will prompt the user as follows:

Enter the number of elements: 3
Enter 3 integers: 
Element 1: 10 
Element 2: 20 
Element 3: 30 
You entered: 
Element 1: 10 
Element 2: 20 
Element 3: 30


## Time Complexity
- **Memory Allocation**: O(n), where n is the number of elements.
- **Input/Output Operations**: O(n), for reading and displaying the integers.
- Overall, the program operates in O(n) time complexity.

## Conclusion
This program provides a foundational understanding of how pointers work in C, illustrating dynamic memory allocation and pointer arithmetic. Mastering these concepts is essential for effective programming in C, especially in scenarios involving data structures and memory management.
