## Introduction

The Pythagoras theorem is a fundamental principle in geometry that defines the relationship between the three sides of a right-angled triangle. This program takes the lengths of two sides of the triangle (the base and the height) as input and calculates the length of the hypotenuse using the formula:

hypotenuse = sqrt{({side1}^2 + {side2}^2)}


## Pythagoras Theorem

For any right-angled triangle, the Pythagoras theorem states:

{(hypotenuse)}^2 = ({side1})^2 + ({side2})^2


This program uses this equation to calculate the length of the hypotenuse.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites

- A C compiler (such as GCC)
- Basic knowledge of C programming and compiling C files

### Steps to Compile and Run:

1. Clone this repository or copy the `pythagoras.c` file.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the `pythagoras.c` file.
3. Compile the C program using a C compiler (e.g., GCC):
   ```bash
   gcc pythagoras.c -o pythagoras


## Applications
Construction and Architecture: Used to calculate the correct lengths for building corners and diagonal measurements to ensure structures are built accurately at right angles.

Navigation and GPS: Helps in determining the shortest path between two points, especially in aviation, marine, and land navigation by calculating distances in a two-dimensional plane.

Surveying: Used by surveyors to measure distances indirectly by forming right triangles between points on land.

Engineering: Applied in various fields of engineering, such as structural, civil, and mechanical engineering, for designing and analyzing components and structures.

Computer Graphics: Used to calculate distances between points, object positions, and collision detection in a two-dimensional or three-dimensional space.

Trigonometry: Forms the basis for trigonometric functions like sine, cosine, and tangent, which are heavily used in physics, mathematics, and engineering.

Physics: Used in calculating vector components, forces, and velocities when dealing with right-angled scenarios, such as projectile motion or inclined planes.
