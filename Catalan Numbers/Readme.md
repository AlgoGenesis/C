Catalan Numbers Recursive Algorithm in C
This project implements the Catalan numbers using recursion in C language. Catalan numbers form a sequence of natural numbers that have important applications in combinatorics, such as:

Counting valid parentheses expressions.
Counting binary search trees (BSTs).
Counting ways to connect points on a circle with non-crossing chords.
Counting distinct ways to triangulate polygons.
This repository demonstrates how to calculate the Catalan numbers using a recursive approach.


How to Compile and Run the Code
Save the code in a file named catalan_recursive.c.
Compile the code using the following command:
bash
Copy code
gcc catalan_recursive.c -o catalan
Run the executable:
bash
Copy code
./catalan
Sample Output
mathematica
Copy code
Enter the number of Catalan numbers to generate: 5
Catalan Numbers:

Time Complexity
Time Complexity: 
ùëÇ(2ùëõ)
O(2n) (exponential) due to repeated calculations of overlapping subproblems.
Space Complexity: 
ùëÇ(ùëõ)
O(n) due to the recursion stack.
Potential Improvements
While recursion provides a simple and intuitive approach, it can be inefficient for large inputs due to overlapping subproblems. This can be optimized using dynamic programming by storing intermediate results in a table to avoid redundant calculations.

Applications of Catalan Numbers
Binary Search Trees (BSTs): Number of ways to form unique BSTs with n nodes.
Valid Parentheses Expressions: Number of valid ways to arrange parentheses.
Polygon Triangulation: Ways to divide a polygon into triangles.
Non-crossing Chords: Counting ways to connect points on a circle without crossing.
