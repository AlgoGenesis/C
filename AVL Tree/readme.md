# 🌳 AVL Tree

## 📖 Description
An **AVL Tree** is a self-balancing binary search tree (BST) where the height difference (balance factor) between the left and right subtrees of any node is at most 1. This self-balancing property ensures that the tree remains balanced, providing better performance for insertion, deletion, and search operations compared to an unbalanced binary tree.

## 🔍 Problem Definition
The goal is to implement a self-balancing binary search tree (AVL tree) to efficiently support:

- **🆕 Insertion** of elements while keeping the tree balanced.
- **❌ Deletion** of elements, ensuring the balance of the tree is restored if necessary.
- **🔎 Searching** for elements efficiently.
- **🌲 Tree Traversals** to visit nodes in specific orders (in-order).

## ⚖️ AVL Property
After every insertion or deletion, the balance factor (difference between the heights of the left and right subtrees) of each node must be maintained between -1 and 1.

## 🛠️ Algorithm Review

### 1. Insertion
- Insert the node similar to a regular binary search tree (BST).
- After insertion, check the balance factor of every ancestor node.
- If the tree becomes unbalanced, perform one of the following rotations:
  - 🔄 Left Rotation
  - 🔄 Right Rotation
  - 🔄 Left-Right Rotation
  - 🔄 Right-Left Rotation

### 2. Deletion
- Delete the node like in a regular BST.
- After deletion, check the balance factor of affected nodes.
- If unbalanced, perform the necessary rotation(s) to restore balance.

### 3. Searching
- Similar to searching in a binary search tree: move left if the value is smaller and move right if the value is larger.

### 4. Tree Traversals
- **🌿 In-order traversal (LNR)**: Returns elements in sorted order.
- **🌟 Pre-order traversal (NLR)**: Visits root first, followed by left and right subtrees.
- **🌼 Post-order traversal (LRN)**: Visits children first, followed by root.

### 5. Rotations
- **🔁 Single Rotations** (Left or Right) are used when the tree is unbalanced on one side.
- **🔀 Double Rotations** (Left-Right or Right-Left) are used when the tree is unbalanced in both directions.

## ⏳ Time Complexity
In an AVL tree, the height is always maintained as **O(log n)**, ensuring efficient operations:
- **🆕 Insertion**: O(log n) (Insertion may involve O(log n) rotations to rebalance the tree.)
- **❌ Deletion**: O(log n) (Deletion may require O(log n) rotations to restore balance.)
- **🔎 Search**: O(log n) (The tree remains balanced, so the search operation takes logarithmic time.)
- **🌲 Traversal**: O(n)
