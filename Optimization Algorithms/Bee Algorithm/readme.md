# Bee Algorithm in C

## Overview

The Bee Algorithm is an optimization technique inspired by the natural behavior of honey bees searching for food sources. This algorithm is part of swarm intelligence and is particularly useful for solving complex optimization problems where traditional methods may struggle. This repository contains a basic implementation of the Bee Algorithm in C, designed to minimize a given objective function.

## Optimization Technique

The Bee Algorithm simulates the foraging behavior of bees, where a colony of bees explores the environment to find the best food sources (solutions) through exploration and exploitation strategies. The main components of the algorithm include:

1. **Initialization**: A population of candidate solutions (bees) is generated randomly within predefined bounds.
2. **Evaluation**: Each solution is evaluated using an objective function. The best solutions are identified as elite solutions.
3. **Neighborhood Search**: Elite solutions explore their neighborhoods to find better solutions by generating nearby candidates and comparing their fitness.
4. **Scouting**: Non-elite solutions are replaced with new random solutions to maintain diversity within the population and avoid local optima.
5. **Iterations**: The process repeats for a specified number of iterations, progressively improving the solutions.

This algorithm is effective for various optimization problems, including continuous function optimization, combinatorial optimization, and multi-objective optimization.

## How to Use

### Prerequisites

- A C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Basic understanding of C programming

### Parameters

You can adjust the following parameters in the code to optimize the algorithm for your specific use case:

- `POP_SIZE`: Total number of solutions (bees)
- `MAX_ITER`: Maximum number of iterations
- `DIM`: Dimension of the optimization problem
- `NEIGHBORS`: Number of neighbor solutions to evaluate per elite solution
- `ELITE_SITES`: Number of elite solutions to retain
- `OTHER_SITES`: Number of other solutions to explore
- `LOWER_BOUND` and `UPPER_BOUND`: Define the search space for the solutions
