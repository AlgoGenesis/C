# Power of a Number Using Recursion

## Description

The power of a number is defined as a number raised to the exponent, which indicates how many times the number is multiplied by itself. Mathematically, it is expressed as:

    `power(base,exponent)=base ^ exponent`

The recursive solution to calculate the power of a number involves reducing the problem to smaller subproblems by decreasing the exponent in each recursive call until the base case is reached.

## Problem Definition

Given two integers base and exponent, the objective is to compute the result of raising base to the power of exponent using a recursive function.

## Algorithm Overview

1. **Base Case**:
   If the exponent is 0, the result is 1 (since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1).
2. **Recursive Case**:
   For any exponent greater than 0, recursively call the function with the exponent decreased by 1.
   The result is base \* power(base, exponent - 1).

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this recursive solution is O(exponent) because the function reduces the exponent by 1 with each recursive call until it reaches 0.

## Limitations

1. **Integer Overflow**: Large values for base and exponent may exceed the capacity of standard data types such as int, leading to incorrect results due to overflow. To handle large numbers, the long long int data type is used, which can handle larger values.

2. **Performance**: This recursive solution is straightforward but not the most efficient for very large exponents. An optimized approach like exponentiation by squaring can reduce the time complexity to O(log exponent).
