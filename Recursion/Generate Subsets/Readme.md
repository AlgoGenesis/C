# Subset Generation Using Recursion
## Description
A subset is a part of a set that contains some or all elements of the original set, but no additional elements. The power set is the set of all subsets, including the empty set and the set itself. For a set of size n, there are 2^n possible subsets.

Subset generation is a common problem in combinatorics and is often used in algorithms related to searching, optimization, and backtracking problems.

## Problem Definition
Given a set of size n, the objective is to generate all possible subsets of the set using a recursive function.

## Algorithm Overview
Base Case: If all elements of the set have been processed, the current subset is printed.
## Recursive Case: 
For each element, explore two possibilities:
Exclude the element from the current subset.
Include the element in the current subset.
Continue this process recursively for each element until all subsets have been generated.
Example
Given the set {1, 2, 3}, the subsets generated would be:

```c
Copy code
{ }
{ 3 }
{ 2 }
{ 2 3 }
{ 1 }
{ 1 3 }
{ 1 2 }
{ 1 2 3 }
```
## Recursive Breakdown
For the set {1, 2, 3}, the recursive breakdown works as follows:

Start with the first element (1). Either include it or exclude it.
Move to the next element (2) and repeat the process.
Continue until the last element (3) is processed.
Print the subset once all elements have been processed.
## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is O(2^n) where n is the number of elements in the set. This is because there are 2^n possible subsets for a set of size n, and each subset is generated by recursively exploring two choices (include or exclude) for each element.

## Limitations
The exponential time complexity makes this approach inefficient for large sets. If the set size increases, the number of subsets grows exponentially.
In cases where large sets need to be handled, more efficient algorithms such as bitwise subset generation can be considered.
