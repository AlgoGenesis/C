# Aho-Corasick Algorithm

## Description

The Aho-Corasick algorithm is a string matching algorithm invented by Alfred V. Aho and Margaret J. Corasick. It's a dictionary-matching algorithm that locates elements of a finite set of strings (the "dictionary") within an input text.

## How it works

1. Construct a finite state machine from the dictionary of patterns.
2. Process the text through the state machine.
3. At each state, report any matches found.

## Time Complexity

O(n + m + z), where n is the length of the text, m is the total length of all patterns, and z is the number of output matches.

## Space Complexity

O(m), where m is the total length of all patterns.

## Use Cases

- Multiple pattern string matching
- Intrusion detection systems
- Spam filters

## Advantages

- Efficient for matching multiple patterns simultaneously
- Linear time complexity regardless of the number of patterns

## Disadvantages

- Requires more memory than single-pattern algorithms
- Construction of the automaton can be complex
