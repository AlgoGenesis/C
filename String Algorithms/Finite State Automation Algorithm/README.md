# Finite State Automation (FSA) Algorithm for String Matching

## Description

The Finite State Automation algorithm is a pattern-matching algorithm that builds a mathematical model (automaton) to efficiently search for patterns in text. It creates a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) that recognizes occurrences of the given pattern.

### Problem Definition

Given:
- A pattern string P of length M
- A text string T of length N

Objective:
- Find all occurrences of pattern P in text T using finite automaton

### Algorithm Overview

1. **Preprocessing Phase**:
   - Build a finite automaton using the pattern
   - Create a transition function table
   - Define states based on pattern prefixes

2. **Searching Phase**:
   - Process the text character by character through the automaton
   - Track state transitions for each character
   - Report matches when final state is reached

### Key Features

- Based on finite automaton theory
- Efficient for single pattern matching
- No backtracking required during search
- Particularly useful for fixed patterns in streaming text
- Handles both text and binary patterns

### Time Complexity

- Preprocessing: O(M × |Σ|), where M is pattern length and |Σ| is alphabet size
- Searching: O(N), where N is text length
- Total: O(M × |Σ| + N)

### Space Complexity

O(M × |Σ|), where:
- M is the pattern length
- |Σ| is the size of the alphabet

## Implementation

The C implementation includes:

1. Transition function computation
2. Automaton construction
3. Pattern searching mechanism
4. Support for multiple pattern searches

## Usage

```c
char* text = "AABAACAADAABAAABAA";
char* pattern = "AABA";
searchFSA(pattern, text);
```

## Advantages

1. Linear-time text processing
2. No backtracking needed
3. Efficient for fixed patterns
4. Suitable for streaming data
5. Predictable performance

## Limitations

1. High preprocessing cost for large alphabets
2. Significant memory usage for transition table
3. Less efficient than simpler algorithms for short patterns
4. Fixed memory requirements regardless of pattern frequency

## Notes

- The implementation uses a simplified transition function
- Memory usage can be optimized for sparse transition matrices
- The algorithm can be extended to handle multiple patterns simultaneously
- Suitable for applications requiring real-time string matching

## Applications

1. Text editors and search utilities
2. Network intrusion detection
3. DNA sequence analysis
4. Pattern matching in streaming data
5. Lexical analysis in compilers
