# Circular Sequence Matching Algorithm 

# Description

The Circular Sequence Matching algorithm identifies the minimum number of rotations required to make two circular sequences identical. If it is impossible to match the sequences through any number of rotations, the algorithm returns -1. This approach is beneficial in fields like DNA sequence matching, circular pattern recognition, and cyclic scheduling, where sequences are considered circular.

# Problem Definition
 Given:

   1.Two sequences,A and B, of equal length 𝑛.

 Objective:

   1.Determine the minimum rotations required to make A and 𝐵 identical.
   2.If it is not possible, return -1.

# Algorithm Overview

 Steps:

  1.Validation:

    Ensure sequences A and B have the same length; otherwise, a circular match is impossible.

  2.Matching with Rotations:

    Concatenate B with itself to get B′ = B + B.

    Check each substring of 𝐵′ with length 𝑛 against A.

    If a match is found at position i, return i as the number of rotations required.

    If no match is found, return -1.

# Example
    For sequences A = "ABCD" and B = "CDAB":

    Concatenate B with itself to get B' = "CDABCDAB".

    Check each rotation:
        CDAB (0 rotations) ≠ ABCD
        DABC (1 rotation) ≠ ABCD
        ABCD (2 rotations) = ABCD

    Result: 2 rotations required.

# Complexity

  Time Complexity: 𝑂(𝑛2) in the worst case, as each rotation requires a comparison.

  Space Complexity: 𝑂(𝑛) for storing the concatenated string.

# Applications

This algorithm can be applied to:

  1.DNA sequence analysis where sequences are circular.
  2.Circular pattern recognition for repeated structures.
  3.Cyclic scheduling tasks that operate in repeating cycles.

# Limitations

  1.The algorithm assumes sequences are of the same length; mismatched lengths return -1.
  2.Rotations greater than the length are not supported, as they would repeat the initial sequence.
