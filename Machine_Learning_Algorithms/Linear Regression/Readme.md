# Linear Regression Algorithm

## Description

Linear Regression is a simple statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is primarily used for predicting a continuous output (real values) based on input variables.

## Key Features
- **Simple Model**: Models the relationship between variables as a straight line.
- **Regression Line**: Finds the best-fit line that minimizes the sum of squared residuals (Least Squares method).
- **Prediction**: Used for predicting a continuous value (e.g., house prices, stock prices).

## Problem Definition

Given a set of data points `(x, y)` representing the independent and dependent variables, Linear Regression computes the best-fit line:
- **Equation**: `y = mx + b`, where `m` is the slope and `b` is the intercept.
- **Input**: A dataset of `x` (features) and `y` (labels).
- **Output**: A regression model that predicts `y` for new values of `x`.

## Algorithm Review

### 1. Mean Calculation
Compute the mean of the `x` values (independent variables) and the `y` values (dependent variables).

### 2. Slope and Intercept Calculation
Use the least squares method to compute the slope (`m`) and intercept (`b`):
- **Slope**: `m = Σ[(x - mean(x)) * (y - mean(y))] / Σ[(x - mean(x))^2]`
- **Intercept**: `b = mean(y) - m * mean(x)`

### 3. Prediction
Use the regression line equation `y = mx + b` to predict new values of `y` for given `x`.

## Time Complexity

- **Calculation of Mean**: O(n), where `n` is the number of data points.
- **Regression Coefficients**: O(n) for calculating the slope and intercept.

## Applications

Linear Regression is used in a variety of fields:
- **Predictive Modeling**: Predict house prices, stock trends, etc.
- **Data Analysis**: Understand relationships between variables.
- **Risk Management**: Analyze and predict risks based on factors.

## Conclusion

Linear Regression is a simple yet effective tool for predictive modeling and data analysis. It provides a clear, interpretable model for understanding relationships between variables. Although limited to linear relationships, it forms the foundation of more complex regression techniques.
