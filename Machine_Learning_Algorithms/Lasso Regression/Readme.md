# Lasso Regression Implementation

## Description

This project presents an implementation of **Lasso Regression** (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) in the C programming language. Lasso Regression is a linear regression technique that incorporates L1 regularization, promoting sparsity in the model by shrinking some coefficients to zero. This approach is particularly beneficial for feature selection and enhancing model interpretability.

## Key Features

- **L1 Regularization**: Implements Lasso regularization to reduce model complexity by shrinking some coefficients to zero.
- **Feature Selection**: Automatically selects important features, aiding in reducing overfitting and improving interpretability.
- **Efficient Algorithm**: Utilizes coordinate descent to optimize the loss function.
- **Scalability**: Suitable for small and medium-sized datasets.
- **Customizable Hyperparameters**: Adjustable regularization parameter (λ) to control the strength of regularization.

## Problem Definition

Given a dataset with n samples and d features, the objective is to fit a linear model to predict a target variable y using the feature matrix X. Lasso Regression modifies the cost function by adding an L1 penalty term:

Cost Function: (1 / 2n) ∑ (y_i - X_i · β)^2 + λ ∑ |β_j|

Where:
- β represents the coefficients.
- λ is the regularization parameter.
- X is the feature matrix.
- y is the target vector.

The goal is to minimize this cost function by adjusting the coefficients, while also encouraging sparsity (shrinking some coefficients to zero).

## Algorithm Review

### Coordinate Descent Algorithm

Lasso Regression is often solved using the **Coordinate Descent** algorithm, which works as follows:

1. **Initialization**: Start with an initial guess for the coefficient vector β, typically set to zero.
2. **Feature-wise Optimization**: Iterate over each feature (coordinate) and optimize the corresponding coefficient while keeping the others fixed.
   - The optimization for each coefficient β_j is done by minimizing the cost function with respect to β_j, including the L1 regularization term.
3. **Thresholding**: Apply soft thresholding to enforce sparsity:
   - If a coefficient's absolute value is below a certain threshold determined by λ, it is set to zero.
4. **Convergence**: Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the coefficients converge or the maximum number of iterations is reached.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of Lasso Regression using the Coordinate Descent method is approximately:

- O(nd · iters), where:
  - n is the number of data points.
  - d is the number of features.
  - iters refers to the number of iterations until convergence.

Lasso's time complexity depends on the size of the dataset, the number of iterations for convergence, and the sparsity of the solution.

## Applications

Lasso Regression is widely used in many applications where feature selection and model simplicity are critical:

1. **High-Dimensional Data**: Lasso is particularly useful when dealing with datasets where the number of features is much larger than the number of samples, such as in bioinformatics or text classification.
2. **Feature Selection**: Automatically selects the most important features, simplifying the model and providing better interpretability.
3. **Economic Forecasting**: Lasso helps identify the most influential predictors in financial markets where many variables may correlate with target outputs.
4. **Medical Research**: Used to select relevant biomarkers in genomics or medical diagnosis, where thousands of potential predictors are analyzed.

## Conclusion

Lasso Regression is a powerful tool for linear modeling when feature selection is required. Its ability to perform L1 regularization helps in producing sparse models that are simpler and more interpretable. By utilizing the Coordinate Descent algorithm, the implementation provides an efficient solution for fitting Lasso models to real-world datasets. The flexibility of adjusting the regularization parameter makes it a versatile tool across many domains, particularly in handling high-dimensional data.
