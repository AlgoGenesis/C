# Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Implementation

## Description

This project presents an implementation of an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** in the C programming language. ANNs are computational models inspired by the human brain, designed to recognize patterns and solve complex problems. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers, allowing them to learn from data and make predictions.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Layer Architecture**: Supports various network architectures including single-layer, multi-layer perceptrons (MLP), and deep networks.
- **Activation Functions**: Implements common activation functions like Sigmoid, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), and Tanh to introduce non-linearity into the model.
- **Backpropagation Algorithm**: Utilizes backpropagation for training the network, adjusting weights based on the gradient of the loss function.
- **Customizable Hyperparameters**: Allows users to configure learning rate, number of epochs, and layer sizes for optimal training.
- **Data Normalization**: Incorporates techniques to preprocess input data for better performance and faster convergence.

## Problem Definition

The objective of this implementation is to create an ANN that can learn from a given dataset and make accurate predictions. Given an input vector \( X \) and a target output \( y \), the ANN aims to minimize the difference between predicted output and actual output through training. The loss function, typically Mean Squared Error (MSE), is used to quantify this difference.

## Algorithm Review

### Feedforward Neural Network

1. **Input Layer**: Takes in the input features.
2. **Hidden Layers**: One or more layers of neurons where the actual computation takes place. Each neuron applies a weighted sum of inputs and passes it through an activation function.
3. **Output Layer**: Produces the final output of the network.

### Backpropagation Algorithm

1. **Forward Pass**: Compute the output of the network based on current weights.
2. **Loss Calculation**: Calculate the loss using the predicted output and the actual target.
3. **Backward Pass**: Compute gradients of the loss with respect to each weight using the chain rule.
4. **Weight Update**: Adjust the weights in the direction that reduces the loss (gradient descent).

## Time Complexity

The time complexity for training an ANN depends on several factors:

- **Forward Pass**: O(n * m) for each layer, where:
  - \( n \) is the number of neurons in the previous layer.
  - \( m \) is the number of neurons in the current layer.

- **Backward Pass**: Also O(n * m), as gradients are computed similarly.

Thus, for a network with \( L \) layers, the overall complexity for one training epoch is approximately:

- **O(E * n * m * L)**, where:
  - \( E \) is the number of epochs.

This can be computationally intensive for large networks and datasets.

## Applications

Artificial Neural Networks have a wide range of applications, including but not limited to:

1. **Image Recognition**: Used in computer vision tasks to classify and identify objects in images.
2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Applied in sentiment analysis, language translation, and chatbots.
3. **Speech Recognition**: Utilized in voice-controlled systems and virtual assistants.
4. **Financial Forecasting**: Employed in predicting stock prices and market trends.
5. **Medical Diagnosis**: Aids in predicting diseases based on patient data.

## Conclusion

Artificial Neural Networks are powerful tools for modeling complex relationships in data. Their ability to learn and generalize from examples makes them suitable for a wide array of applications. This implementation serves as a foundation for understanding ANNs and can be expanded to include advanced techniques such as convolutional layers, dropout for regularization, and various optimization algorithms. As machine learning continues to evolve, ANNs remain at the forefront of research and practical applications in artificial intelligence.
