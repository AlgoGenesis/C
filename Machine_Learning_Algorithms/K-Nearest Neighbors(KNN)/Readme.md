# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm

## Description

The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple, instance-based learning algorithm used for classification and regression. It operates by comparing the distance between a target data point and its neighbors in the training data, predicting the label based on the majority vote of the nearest neighbors.

## Key Features
- **Instance-based Learning**: KNN classifies a new data point by comparing it to the training data.
- **Distance Metric**: Uses Euclidean distance to measure similarity between data points.
- **No Training Phase**: All computation happens during classification, not beforehand.
- **Multi-Class Support**: Can classify data points into multiple categories.

## Problem Definition

Given a dataset and a target data point, KNN identifies the `k` nearest neighbors and classifies the target based on the majority label of the neighbors.

- **Input**: Training data consisting of labeled data points and a target data point to classify.
- **Output**: The predicted class label for the target data point.

## Algorithm Review

### 1. Initialization
Choose a value for `k` (number of neighbors) and decide the distance metric (Euclidean distance in this implementation).

### 2. Distance Calculation
For every data point in the training set, calculate its distance from the target point using the Euclidean distance formula.

### 3. Sorting Neighbors
Sort the data points by increasing distance to the target.

### 4. Majority Voting
From the `k` closest neighbors, count the labels and assign the most frequent label to the target point.

## Time Complexity

- **Distance Calculation**: O(n * d), where `n` is the number of data points and `d` is the dimensionality of the data (number of features).
- **Sorting**: O(n log n) to sort the distances.
- **Overall**: O(n * d + n log n).

## Applications

K-Nearest Neighbors is commonly used in:
- **Classification Tasks**: Handwriting digit recognition, image classification, etc.
- **Regression Tasks**: Predicting numerical values like housing prices.
- **Recommendation Systems**: Suggesting items based on user similarity.

## Conclusion

KNN is a powerful, easy-to-understand algorithm suitable for many classification and regression tasks. It is highly interpretable but can be computationally expensive for large datasets. The choice of `k` and distance metric are crucial for optimal performance.
