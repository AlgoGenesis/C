# Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

## Description
   **PCA**is an unsupervised learning algorithm that transforms correlated features into a set of linearly uncorrelated components called principal components.

## Overview
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a widely used dimensionality reduction technique in machine learning and data analysis. It helps reduce the number of features in a dataset by projecting it onto a lower-dimensional subspace, while preserving as much variability (information) as possible.

## Problem Definition

Given:
- A high-dimensional dataset with correlated features
- A desired number of principal components (k)
Objective:
- Reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while retaining the most important variance in the data
- Extract the most important features from the data
- Visualize high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space

        Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is an unsupervised learning algorithm used for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction in datasets with correlated features. By projecting data onto a lower-dimensional subspace, PCA retains the most significant variance, facilitating data visualization and noise reduction.

## Pseudocode
function pca(X, k):
    // Standardize the data
    X_std = standardize(X)

    // Calculate the covariance matrix
    cov_matrix = calculate_covariance_matrix(X_std)

    // Calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors
    eigenvalues, eigenvectors = calculate_eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors(cov_matrix)

    // Sort the eigenvectors by their corresponding eigenvalues
    sorted_eigenvectors = sort_eigenvectors(eigenvalues, eigenvectors)

    // Select the top k eigenvectors
    selected_eigenvectors = select_top_k_eigenvectors(sorted_eigenvectors, k)

    // Transform the original data into the new feature space
    X_pca = transform_data(X_std, selected_eigenvectors)

    // Calculate the explained variance ratio
    explained_variance_ratio = calculate_explained_variance_ratio(eigenvalues, k)

    return X_pca, explained_variance_ratio
