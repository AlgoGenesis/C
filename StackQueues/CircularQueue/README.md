Circular Queue: Key Concepts
Definition:

A circular queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle but connects the end of the queue back to the front, effectively forming a circle.

Implementation:

Can be implemented using arrays or linked lists.
Utilizes two pointers (front and rear) to track the start and end of the queue.
Advantages:

Efficient use of space by reusing empty slots once elements are dequeued.
Eliminates the waste of space that occurs in regular queues when the front elements are dequeued.
Disadvantages:

Requires careful handling of pointers to avoid confusion between empty and full states.
Fixed size in array-based implementations can lead to overflow even when space is available due to pointer wrapping.
Applications:

Buffer management (e.g., CPU scheduling).
Circular scheduling (e.g., Round Robin scheduling).
Managing tasks in a cyclic manner (e.g., ticketing systems).
Complexity:

Time Complexity:
Enqueue: O(1)
Dequeue: O(1)
Front: O(1)
Space Complexity: O(n) for n elements in the circular queue.
