README.md: Integer Partition Algorithm
Overview
This project demonstrates an Integer Partition Algorithm implemented in C. The program computes all possible ways to partition a given integer n into sums of positive integers. The integer partition problem is a fundamental problem in combinatorics, where the objective is to express a positive integer as the sum of other positive integers in every possible combination.

Key Concepts
Integer Partition:
An integer partition of a number n is a way of writing n as a sum of positive integers, disregarding the order of the summands.
For example, the integer partitions of 4 are:
4
3 + 1
2 + 2
2 + 1 + 1
1 + 1 + 1 + 1
Project Structure
main.c: The C program file containing the logic for generating integer partitions.
README.md: Provides an explanation of the project, algorithms used, and how to run the program.
Features
Recursive Algorithm: Uses recursion to generate all partitions of a given integer.
Array Storage: Stores the partitions in an array dynamically and prints each partition as it is generated.
Efficient Calculation: Uses backtracking and bounds the recursion by ensuring the next integer in the partition is less than or equal to the current one, reducing unnecessary computations.
Algorithm Description
1. Recursive Partition Generation:
The recursive function integerPartitions generates all possible partitions of the integer n.
The recursion continues by reducing the remaining value of n and ensuring that no integer in the partition exceeds the previous one.
If the remaining value of n becomes 0, the partition is complete, and it is printed.
2. Partition Printing:
The printPartition function formats and prints each partition.
Each partition is displayed as a sum of integers separated by a plus (+) symbol.
How to Run
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
Compile the program: Use the following command to compile the C program:

bash
Copy code
gcc main.c -o integer_partitions
Run the program: After compiling, run the executable:

bash
Copy code
./integer_partitions
Input: Enter a positive integer when prompted to generate all partitions of that integer.

Example Usage
bash
Copy code
Enter an integer: 4
Integer partitions of 4:
4
3 + 1
2 + 2
2 + 1 + 1
1 + 1 + 1 + 1
bash
Copy code
Enter an integer: 5
Integer partitions of 5:
5
4 + 1
3 + 2
3 + 1 + 1
2 + 2 + 1
2 + 1 + 1 + 1
1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
Code Walkthrough
Key Functions:
printPartition(int arr[], int length):

Prints a partition in the format of a sum. For example, 4 + 3 + 2.
Takes the partition stored in the array arr and prints it based on its length.
integerPartitions(int n, int max, int arr[], int index):

Recursively generates all possible partitions of the integer n.
The partition generation stops when n becomes 0, meaning a valid partition has been found.
Limits each partition by ensuring the next integer is less than or equal to the previous one to avoid duplicates.
generatePartitions(int n):

Initializes the array to store partitions and calls the recursive integerPartitions function to generate all partitions of n.
main():

Takes user input for the integer n and calls the generatePartitions function to compute and display all partitions.
Edge Cases
n = 1: The partition of 1 is simply 1.
n = 0 or negative input: The program does not generate partitions for non-positive integers and instead outputs an appropriate message.
