# Fractal Generation (Mandelbrot Set)

## Description

The **Mandelbrot Set** is a famous fractal that is defined in the complex plane. It is generated by iterating a simple mathematical formula and visualizing the result. This program generates the Mandelbrot Set and outputs the fractal in a text format.

## Problem Definition

The task is to generate the Mandelbrot set for a defined range in the complex plane and represent it visually. Each point in the complex plane is iterated, and based on the number of iterations before divergence, a corresponding character is printed.

### Input:

- Ranges for real and imaginary parts:
  - Minimum and maximum values for real and imaginary components.

### Output:

- A text-based representation of the Mandelbrot set.

### Example Output:

           *
      *         *

-                     *
                      *
                *

## Algorithm

1. **Initialization**: Set up the dimensions and maximum iterations for generating the fractal.
2. **Loop Through Each Pixel**: For each pixel on the output grid, convert the pixel coordinates to a point in the complex plane.
3. **Iterate the Function**: For each point, iterate the function `z = z*z + c` until it escapes the boundary (usually when |z| > 2) or until a maximum number of iterations is reached.
4. **Output the Pixel Value**: Based on the number of iterations taken for a point to escape, output a character representing that point.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is **O(n*m*MAX_ITER)**, where:

- `n` is the width of the output,
- `m` is the height of the output,
- `MAX_ITER` is the maximum number of iterations for each point.

## Compilation and Execution

To compile and run the program:

```bash
gcc mandelbrot.c -o mandelbrot
./mandelbrot
```
