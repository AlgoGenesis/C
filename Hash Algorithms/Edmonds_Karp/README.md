Edmonds-Karp Algorithm:

Overview:
The Edmonds-Karp Algorithm is a specific implementation of the Ford-Fulkerson method to find the maximum flow in a flow network. It uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path from the source to the sink, maximizing flow efficiently.

Steps:
Initialize Flow: Set initial flow through each edge to zero.
BFS for Augmenting Paths: Use BFS to find paths with available capacity.
Augment Flow: For each path, add the minimum capacity found along that path.
Repeat until no more paths are found.

Complexity:
Time Complexity: 𝑂(𝑉× 𝐸^2),  where V is the number of vertices, and E is the number of edges.

Usage:
This algorithm is useful in applications requiring network flow optimization, such as traffic routing, resource allocation, and bipartite matching.
