# XOR Hash Algorithm

## Description

The XOR hash algorithm is a simple and efficient method to compute a hash value from a string using the XOR operation. It processes each character in the string, applying the XOR operator to combine their ASCII values into a single hash. This algorithm is primarily used for basic checksums and non-cryptographic applications.

### Problem Definition

Given:
- A string `input_string` of characters.

Objective:
- Compute an 8-bit hash value for `input_string` using the XOR operation.

### Algorithm Overview

1. Initialize a hash value, `hash_value`, to `0`.
2. For each character in `input_string`:
   - XOR the ASCII value of the character with `hash_value`.
3. Return the final `hash_value` after processing all characters.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the XOR hash algorithm is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the string. This makes it efficient for generating hashes for short to moderately long strings.
