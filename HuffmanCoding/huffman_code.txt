INTRODUCTION: 
Huffman coding is a lossless compression algorithm that reduces data size by assigning shorter binary codes to more frequent characters and longer codes to less frequent ones.

STEPS: 
Frequency Calculation: Count the frequency of each character.
Build Huffman Tree: Construct a binary tree based on character frequencies.
Generate Codes: Assign binary codes to each character.
Encoding: Replace characters with their binary codes.

EXAMPLE:
For the string "hello":
Frequencies: h=1, e=1, l=2, o=1
Generated codes: h=00, e=01, l=10, o=11
Encoded: "hello" â†’ 0001101110

SAMPLE INPUT/OUTPUT OF THE CODE:

Enter number of characters: 4
Enter the characters:
Character 1: a
Character 2: b
Character 3: c
Character 4: d
Enter the frequencies:
Frequency of a: 9
Frequency of b: 12
Frequency of c: 10
Frequency of d: 5
Huffman Codes:
d: 00
a: 01
c: 10
b: 11
