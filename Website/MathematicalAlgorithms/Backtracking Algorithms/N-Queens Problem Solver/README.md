# N-Queens Problem Solver

## Description

The **N-Queens Problem Solver** is a C program that employs a backtracking algorithm to find solutions for placing N queens on an N×N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. This classic problem serves as an excellent illustration of the backtracking technique in algorithm design.

## Features

- **Multiple Solutions**: Capable of finding and displaying multiple valid arrangements of queens on the chessboard.
- **Customizable Board Size**: The size of the chessboard can be easily adjusted by modifying the constant `N` in the code.

## Algorithm Overview

The program utilizes the following steps:

1. **Recursive Backtracking**: The algorithm attempts to place queens in each column of the chessboard and checks for safety using the `isSafe` function.
   
2. **Solution Validation**: If a valid position is identified, the queen is placed, and the algorithm recurses to place the next queen in the subsequent column.

3. **Backtracking**: If no valid position can be found for a queen, the algorithm backtracks by removing the previously placed queen and trying the next row in the current column.

## How to Run

To execute the program, follow these steps:

1. **Compile the Code**: Use a C compiler to compile the source code. For example:
   ```bash
   gcc -o n_queens n_queens.c

2. **Run the compiled code**:
   ```bash
   ./n_queens

## Example Output

Upon execution, the program will display the board with queens placed in valid positions. For instance, the output for a 4×4 board might look like this
 1  0  0  0 
 0  0  1  0 
 0  0  0  1 
 0  1  0  0 

## Limitations 

The default implementation is set to solve the 4-Queens problem, but users can easily change the constant N to solve for different board sizes
