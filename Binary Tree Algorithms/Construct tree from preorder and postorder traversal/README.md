To construct a binary tree from preorder and postorder traversals, we can use the following approach. Given the nature of the traversals, we know:

# The first element of the preorder traversal is the root of the tree.
# In the postorder traversal, the last element is also the root of the tree.

Here's a step-by-step algorithm to construct the binary tree:

=> Base Cases:

# If the preorder array is empty, return None.
# If the length of the preorder and postorder arrays is 1, create a new node with that value and return it.


=> Root Identification:

# The first element of the preorder array is the root node.
# Find the index of this root node in the postorder array. This helps us determine the boundaries of the left and right subtrees.


=> Subtree Construction:

# The number of nodes in the left subtree can be determined by the index of the root in the postorder array.
# Recursively repeat the process for the left and right subtrees.


=> Explanation of the Code:
1. TreeNode Structure: Defines the structure of a tree node.
2. createNode Function: Allocates memory for a new tree node and initializes it.
3. findIndex Function: Finds the index of a value in the postorder array.
4. constructTree Function: Recursively constructs the binary tree using the provided preorder and postorder arrays. It determines the root and constructs left and right subtrees.
5. printInOrder Function: Prints the inorder traversal of the tree, which can be used to verify the structure of the constructed tree.
6. main Function: Sets up the preorder and postorder arrays, calls the tree construction function, and prints the inorder traversal of the resulting tree.
