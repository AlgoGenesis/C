## What is Binary Tree? ##

A Binary Tree Data Structure is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. It is commonly used in computer science for efficient storage and retrieval of data, with various operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.


## What is inorder? ##

Inorder traversal of a binary tree is a depth-first method where nodes are visited in a specific order: left subtree first, then the root node, and finally the right subtree. This traversal pattern ensures that nodes in a Binary Search Tree (BST) are accessed in ascending order. In general binary trees, Inorder traversal does not guarantee sorted order but still follows the left-root-right sequence. This approach is widely used in applications where sorted order retrieval is essential, particularly in BST operations like searching and printing elements in order.


## What is preorder ?##

Preorder traversal in a binary tree is a technique that visits nodes in the order of root, left subtree, and then right subtree. This traversal starts from the root node, processing it first before moving down each branch. In a Binary Search Tree (BST), Preorder traversal doesnâ€™t produce nodes in sorted order but is still useful for various applications like creating a copy of the tree, expressing the tree structure, or evaluating expressions in expression trees. The "root-first" nature of Preorder is especially useful for situations where operations need to happen before diving into subtrees.


## Construct a Binary Tree from Inorder and Preorder ##

The algorithm constructs a binary tree using inorder and preorder traversals. The first element of the preorder traversal is the root. The algorithm locates this root in the inorder traversal to determine the left and right subtrees. It uses recursion to build the left and right subtrees by updating the inorder range based on the root's index. The base case is when there are no elements to process. After the tree is constructed, a separate function prints the preorder traversal of the constructed tree. The algorithm operates in O(n) time complexity, efficiently reconstructing the tree from the traversals.
