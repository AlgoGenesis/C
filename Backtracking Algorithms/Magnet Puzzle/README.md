### Magnet Puzzle Algorithm

## Description
The **Magnet Puzzle** is a logic puzzle where magnets, each with a north (N) and south (S) pole, must be placed on a grid. The goal is to arrange the magnets so that no two magnets of the same type are adjacent, either horizontally or vertically. This puzzle challenges players to find valid configurations, often using backtracking algorithms to explore possible placements and ensure compliance with the rules.

## Problem Definition
Given:
- A rectangular grid containing blank spaces and magnets with positive and negative poles, and clues about
    the number of positive and negative poles in each row and column.
Objective:
- Place the magnets and blanks in the grid such that the clues are satisfied and no two magnets with the same polarity are adjacent horizontally or vertically.

## Overview

    The Magnet Puzzle is a combinatorial logic puzzle that involves placing magnets on a grid under specific constraints. Each magnet has two poles: a north (N) pole and a south (S) pole. The main objective is to arrange the magnets in such a way that no two magnets of the same type are adjacent, either horizontally or vertically.

# Key Points:

- Grid-Based: The puzzle is played on a 2D grid, where each cell can either contain a magnet or be empty.
- Placement Rules: The primary rule is that magnets of the same type cannot be placed next to each other.
- Solving Techniques: Common algorithms for solving the puzzle include backtracking, which explores potential configurations and backtracks upon encountering invalid placements.
- Problem-Solving: The Magnet Puzzle serves as an engaging challenge for those interested in logic puzzles and algorithm design.

    This puzzle not only provides entertainment but also enhances logical reasoning and computational thinking skills.
