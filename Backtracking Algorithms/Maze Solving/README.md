### Maze Solving Algorithm
##Description
The Maze Solving Algorithm is a recursive approach that explores all possible paths in a maze to find a route from the starting point to the destination. This is typically achieved using techniques like Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS).

### Problem Definition
The objective is to find a path in a 2D grid (maze) from the top-left corner (start point) to the bottom-right corner (end point), avoiding obstacles. The maze is represented as a grid where 1 denotes a traversable cell and 0 denotes a blocked cell.

### Given:
A 2D array maze[N][N] with predefined elements representing the maze structure.

##Objective:
To determine a valid path through the maze in minimum time complexity.

### Algorithm Overview
The Maze Solving Algorithm typically follows these steps:
Check Validity: At each cell, check if moving to that cell is valid (within bounds and not blocked).
Recursive Exploration: From the current cell, recursively explore adjacent cells (down, right, up, left) until the destination is reached.
Backtracking: If a path to the destination is not found from the current cell, backtrack by marking the cell as unvisited and explore other paths.
Path Recording: Keep track of the path taken to reconstruct the solution once the destination is reached.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of the Maze Solving Algorithm is O(N^2) in the worst case, where

N is the total number of cells in the maze. This occurs when every cell is explored to find the path, especially in dense mazes.
