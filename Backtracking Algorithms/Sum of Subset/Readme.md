# Subset Sum Problem - Backtracking Algorithm

## Overview
This C program implements a backtracking algorithm to solve the Subset Sum Problem, which identifies subsets of a given set of positive integers that sum to a specified target value.

## How It Works
The program recursively explores all possible subsets of the input set, evaluating both including and excluding each element. If a subset with the desired sum is found, it is printed to the console.

### Key Functions
- **sum_of_subsets(int s, int k, int rem)**: This function performs the core backtracking logic. It checks:
  - If the current subset sum equals the target value.
  - If further exploration is possible based on remaining values.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- C compiler (e.g., GCC)

### Compilation
To compile the program, use the following command:
```bash
gcc subset_sum.c -o subset_sum
```

### Execution
Run the program with the following command:
```bash
./subset_sum
```

### Input Format
1. The program will prompt you to enter the number of elements in the set.
2. Next, you will input the elements in increasing order.
3. Finally, you will specify the target sum.

### Example
```
enter no of elements: 5
enter the elements in increasing order: 1 2 3 4 5
enter the sum: 5
```

**Output:**
```
subset = 1
1 4 
subset = 2
2 3 
subset = 3
5 
```

## Limitations
- The program assumes the input elements are provided in increasing order. 
- If the total sum of the input elements is less than the target sum, or if the smallest element is greater than the target sum, the program will indicate that no subset is possible.
