# Round Robin Scheduling Algorithm

## Description

The **Round Robin (RR)** scheduling algorithm is a preemptive scheduling algorithm that assigns a fixed time unit (quantum) to each process in a cyclic order. This approach ensures that all processes receive equal CPU time, making it suitable for time-sharing systems. The algorithm is designed to minimize waiting time and provide a fair allocation of CPU time among all processes.

### Problem Definition

Given:
- A set of processes, each with a burst time and arrival time.

Objective:
- Schedule the processes using the Round Robin algorithm and calculate the waiting time and turnaround time for each process.

### Input

- Number of processes.
- For each process, the burst time and arrival time.
- Quantum time (time slice) for the Round Robin scheduling.

### Output

- A table displaying the process ID, arrival time, burst time, waiting time, and turnaround time.


### Algorithm Overview

1. **Input Processes**: The user inputs the number of processes, their burst times, arrival times, and the quantum time.
2. **Scheduling**: Processes are scheduled in a cyclic order using the quantum time. Each process executes for the quantum time or until it finishes, whichever is smaller.
3. **Calculate Waiting Time**: For each process, the waiting time is calculated based on the time spent waiting in the queue.
4. **Calculate Turnaround Time**: The turnaround time for each process is calculated as the sum of its burst time and waiting time.
5. **Display Results**: The results are displayed in a formatted table.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the Round Robin scheduling algorithm is generally as follows:

- **Best Case**: `O(n)` for very short burst times and a small number of processes.
- **Average Case**: `O(n^2)` in the general case, as processes may need to be scheduled multiple times.
- **Worst Case**: `O(n^2)` when all processes have long burst times and there are many context switches.

### Advantages

- Ensures fair CPU time allocation among processes.
- Simple and easy to implement.

### Disadvantages

- High context switching overhead for large numbers of processes.
- Not suitable for processes with significantly different burst times.

### Conclusion

The Round Robin algorithm is effective in time-sharing environments, ensuring that all processes receive an equal share of CPU time. While it may not be the most efficient for all scenarios, it is widely used due to its fairness and simplicity.
