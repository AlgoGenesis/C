Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) Scheduling:
Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) is a preemptive version of the Shortest Job First (SJF) scheduling algorithm. In SRTF, the operating system always selects the process with the shortest remaining burst time to execute next, preempting the currently running process if necessary. This preemptive scheduling approach aims to minimize the average waiting time and is especially suitable for systems that need quick response times.

Key Concepts in SRTF
1.Preemptive Scheduling:In SRTF, if a new process arrives with a burst time shorter than the remaining burst time of the currently running process, the current process is preempted. The CPU is then allocated to the new process with the shorter burst time.
Process Properties:

1.Burst Time (BT): The total time required by a process for execution.
2.Arrival Time (AT): The time when a process arrives in the ready queue.
3.Remaining Time (RT): Time left for a process to complete. Initially, this is equal to the burst time and decreases as the process runs.
4.Completion Time (CT):The time at which a process completes its execution.
5.Turnaround Time (TAT):The total time taken for a process to complete, calculated as:
Turnaround Time (TAT)=Completion Time (CT)-Arrival Time (AT)
6.Waiting Time (WT):The total time a process spends waiting in the ready queue, calculated as:
Waiting Time (WT)=Turnaround Time (TAT)−Burst Time (BT)
Working of the SRTF Algorithm
1.Initialization:

Set the current time to 0 and the completion count to 0.
Initialize the remaining time for each process to be equal to its burst time.
2.Process Selection:

At every unit of time, iterate through all processes in the ready queue to find the one with the shortest remaining burst time that has arrived (i.e., its arrival time is less than or equal to the current time).
If no process is ready, increment the time until a process arrives.
3.Execution and Preemption:

The selected process with the shortest remaining time runs for one unit of time.
After every unit of time, check for new arrivals that may preempt the currently running process.
4.Completion:

When a process's remaining time becomes 0, it completes, and the algorithm calculates its completion time, turnaround time, and waiting time.
The process is marked as completed, and the completion count is incremented.
5.Repeat:

Continue this process until all processes are completed.

Time Complexity Analysis
The time complexity of the SRTF algorithm depends on the number of processes n:

1.Process Selection:

At each unit of time, the scheduler needs to scan all processes to find the one with the shortest remaining time. This takes O(n) time.
2.Total Runtime:

In the worst case, this scanning is repeated for every unit of burst time for all processes. Assuming the total burst time across all processes is 
𝑇
T, the time complexity becomes O(n \times T).
Space Complexity:

Since we only store a fixed amount of information per process, the space complexity is O(n).
Pros and Cons of SRTF
Pros:

1.Optimal Waiting Time: SRTF minimizes the average waiting time for processes compared to non-preemptive scheduling algorithms.
2.High Efficiency for Short Jobs: Short processes get completed quickly, which is beneficial for time-sharing environments where quick response times are essential.
Cons:

1.High Complexity: Due to frequent context switches, the implementation complexity and overhead are high, especially if burst times are dynamic or unpredictable.
2.Starvation: Longer processes might face starvation if shorter processes continuously arrive, causing delays in their execution.
Applications of SRTF
1.SRTF is useful in environments where:

2.There is a high number of short processes interspersed with a few long ones.
3.Quick response times are required, such as in real-time systems and time-sharing systems.
Conclusion
The Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) algorithm optimizes waiting time but at the cost of increased complexity. Its preemptive nature suits environments where system responsiveness is crucial, though it requires careful handling to avoid excessive context switching and starvation of longer processes.
