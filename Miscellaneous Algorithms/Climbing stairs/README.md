# Climbing Stairs :

## Description
We will perform a programme in C language called climbing stairs

### Problem Defination

Given a collection of elements, the goal is to:

1. You are climbing a staircase.


2. It takes n steps to reach the top.


3. Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps

4. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?



### Examples : 

Example 1:

Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps



Example 2:

Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
 




### Time Complexity

Time complexity: O(n)
n is number of steps to reach the top.

Space complexity: O(n)
For dp list
