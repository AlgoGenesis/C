# Ramer-Douglas-Peucker Algorithm

## Overview

The Ramer-Douglas-Peucker algorithm is a line simplification technique that reduces the number of points in a curve while preserving its overall shape. It is widely utilized in computer graphics, geographical information systems (GIS), and various applications where simplifying complex paths is necessary.

## Key Features

- **Reduces Points:** Effectively simplifies a set of points by removing unnecessary ones.
- **Maintains Shape:** Preserves the overall shape and structure of the original curve.
- **Adjustable Tolerance:** Provides adjustable tolerance levels to control the degree of simplification.

## How It Works

1. **Start and End Points:** The algorithm begins with the first and last points of the set.
2. **Farthest Point:** It identifies the point that is farthest from the line segment connecting the start and end points.
3. **Tolerance Check:** If the farthest point is farther than a specified tolerance (epsilon), it is retained, and the algorithm recursively applies to the segments before and after this point.
4. **Recursion:** If the farthest point is within the tolerance, the segment is simplified by keeping only the start and end points.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. **Compile the Code:** Use a C compiler to compile the source code file.
3. **Run the Executable:** Execute the compiled program and provide the input points and tolerance.

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The average-case time complexity of the Ramer-Douglas-Peucker algorithm is O(n log n), where n is the number of points in the original set. However, in the worst case, it can approach O(nÂ²) due to the recursive nature of the algorithm.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is O(n) for storing the output points.

## Conclusion

The Ramer-Douglas-Peucker algorithm is an efficient and effective way to simplify curves and shapes, making it an essential tool for various applications in computer graphics and GIS. By using adjustable tolerance, users can control the degree of simplification to suit their specific needs.
